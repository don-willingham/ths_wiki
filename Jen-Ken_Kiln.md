Jen-Ken JK-1811 Kiln
--------------------

This kiln was donated to us but has not yet been set up or used at the space. It requires 20 amp 240V power, which is available in the building, but is being used for other equipment.

If anyone is interested in using this kiln, we can start working towards setting it up for use.

The manual is on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1BiUKpVQf5ncEJaWmo3RVJ2b3M).
