[ 3D Printers](3D_Printers.md "wikilink")
--------------------------------------

3d printers extrude thin layers of plastic to create almost any object for which you can design a model. There are many pre-designed objects available on \[<http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=steampunk&sa>= Thingiverse\].

**Note**: Due to the nature of 3D printing, objects take a LONG time to print, often HOURS for larger objects.

Project ideas:

-   A [3d Printed Wimshurst Machine](http://steampunkworkshop.com/3d-printed-wimshurst-machine/) ([Files on Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:633673))
-   3D print moving functional gears!
-   3D print levers, frames, assemblies for props
-   3D print [greebles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeble) for props and costumes
-   3D print [“skeleton keys” (Thingiverse)](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:719083)
-   3D print Steampunk jewelry
-   3D print “connectors” for wires, pipes and hoses on props or costumes

(A chess set will take many hours to print, probably over 60.)

Tampa Hackerspace has multiple colors of ABS and PLA plastic filament available for use. You WILL NEED to bring:

-   Model of 3d objects in STL or OBJ format that fits in a 225mm x 145mm x 150mm build envelope.
-   Although you can work on design at the Hackerspace, due to the long print times, it's recommended you arrive with your model ready to print.
