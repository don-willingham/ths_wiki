Shop Bot

Tool Description:
-----------------

The ShopBot is a CNC (Computer Numerically Controlled) router. It is capable of cutting pieces out of 4 foot by 8 foot sheets of material. (i.e. plywood or MDF)

We use VCarvePro for layout, toolpath creation, and save toolpaths with post processing for ShopBot.

Materials (what to use, and not use, it on):
--------------------------------------------

-   Wood (MDF, plywood, hard woods, soft woods (pine, poplar), etc)
-   High density foam
-   Metals
-   Acrylic?
-   Other??

General and Special Safety Considerations:
------------------------------------------

'''This is not an exhaustive list!

-   **Always wear safety glasses.**
-   **Read, understand and follow all warning labels, instructions and safety manuals.**

Classes:
--------

-   We are currently working to build a class, however, William Stillwell and others do offer 1:1 training when they are available ( Generally Open Make night is good, please coordinate with him a ahead of time, and have material ready )

When asking for training on the ShopBot, you should first have (pre-requsites):

-   Taken the wood shop class so you know how we want things cleaned up.
-   A basic understanding of work holding, feeds and speeds, and conventional and climb cutting (as taught in the machine shop class).
-   A project idea, and have either already generated vector files for your project, or, for simpler designs, measurements of the pieces you want to cut out. This could be as simple as a couple boxes and a circle cut from a piece of plywood.
-   Material to use to cut. This could be a sheet of wood, or an appropriate scrap from the wood bin. Your material should be relatively flat, free of any metal (nails, screws, staples) and in good condition. I.e. not rotting, splintering boards you found on the side of the road.

Pre-Use checklist:
------------------

Before using the ShopBot, you should:

-   Ensure that the gantry (y-axis) is square to the rest of the ShopBot frame.
-   Zero out your X and Y axises to the desired location.
-   Ensure you have the desired bit installed in the router.
-   Zero out your Z axis.
-   Triple check that your intended cut path will not impact any holddowns
-   Wear hearing and eye protection.
-   Activate the JET dust collection vacuum system.
-   Before hitting “Cut Part”, do a bladder check.
-   “Cut Part”. You will be prompted to turn on the router. (“Spindle”)

Post-Use Checklist (cleanup, etc):
----------------------------------

When you have finished using the ShopBot, be sure that you:

-   Return the tool to the traditional \[0,0\] position in the lower-left corner. Zero the axises if they have been changed.
-   Install a standard cutter bit if you have changed to a specialized bit.
-   Vacuum or sweep wood chips, debris and dust off the bed and the tool.
-   Use compressed air to blow dust off the ShopBot itself, the computers, and the work bench.
-   Sweep up dust and debris in the area around the ShopBot.
-   Return any other tools you have used to their storage location.
-   Turn off the ShopBot CPU.
-   Turn off the laptop.
-   Turn off the power strip and the light above.
