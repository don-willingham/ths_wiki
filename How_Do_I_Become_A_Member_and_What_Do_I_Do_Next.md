Anyone is welcome to be a social member and participate in [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TampaHack/), [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Hackerspace) and other social media discussions. You're welcome to attend classes (members get a discount) and bring your projects to work on during OpenMake nights on most Tuesdays (the first Tuesday of the month is a closed member's meeting). Ask for a tour of the space if you haven't already been shown around.

Certain classes and tools are open to members only.

To become a full, paying, member:

-   Go to the [Tampa Hackerspace's](http://tampahackerspace.com/) main webpage and click on [Join](http://tampahackerspace.com/membership/). Members get 24/7 access to the Space, and can use our tools once they're trained (usually by taking the classes at a discounted rate). Non-members can still take classes in tool use and can purchase day-passes to use them.

<!-- -->

-   Regular membership is $50/month. Once you've paid your membership dues and completed the required paperwork (see the “Join” page linked above), you'll be a member.

<!-- -->

-   The first thing you should do is introduce yourself to the Board of Directors so they know who you are.

<!-- -->

-   Then you need to take the New Member Orientation. This is held on an as-needed basis and covers topics like opening and closing the Space, enabling and disabling the alarm system, policies and procedures, some introductions, and getting a key-fob if your dues pay on a recurring basis (i.e, your credit card automatically gets charged).

<!-- -->

-   If you haven't already, you should join the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TampaHack/) and [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Hackerspace) groups so you can participate in discussions, and know what's going on at the Hackerspace, including classes and meet-ups. [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Hackerspace/events/) is **THE** place where schedules are posted. Join [Slack](Using_Slack "wikilink") for communication with other members.
