Installing
----------

-   [Download and install OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) by OS.
    -   ([Direct link to files](http://files.openscad.org/snapshots/))

Note: The most recent release as of 2016-July-4 appears to be openscad-2015.03-3. Linux repos, even the PPAs, are likely out of date and don't support all the features discussed in the online manual. Consider installing from the source file [Linux tar.gz](http://files.openscad.org/) if you want a more recent official version. If you want the bleeding edge, install from the github repo: [<https://github.com/openscad/openscad>](https://github.com/openscad/openscad).
