The extension table for the saw has a router mount that allows the same surface to be used as a table saw or a router table.

The SawStop user manual is on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1BiUKpVQf5nWG5DSlI5WmtwbGM).

Safety
------

-   Read and follow [the manual](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1BiUKpVQf5nWG5DSlI5WmtwbGM)
-   Understand the basics of [table saw operation](http://www.startwoodworking.com/post/tablesaw-primer-ripping-and-crosscutting)
-   Don't crosscut using the fence - use the miter gauge (or a sled)
-   Use the blade guard with splitter or the [riving knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riving_knife)
-   Use a push stick for narrow cuts
-   Wear appropriate protection: safety glasses and possibly hearing and dust protection

SawStop Safety Brake Feature
----------------------------

Be aware of the SawStop's safety brake feature. It works by detecting an electrical charge draining from the blade assembly, so as soon as the spinning blade makes enough contact with a person's skin / blood, it drops the blade down and throws a block of aluminum into the blade to stop it.

This can accidentally be activated when sawing wet or other electrically conductive materials or if the blade hits a nail or screw.

Each activation costs about $75 for a new safety cartridge and saw blade. We set aside a budget to periodically replace these because accidents happen. But if we determine that the safety feature was activated without a good reason, we may ask the responsible party to cover the replacement cost.

Router Table
------------

The SawStop table has an integrated router mount. The mount is a Kreg 420 / PRS3000 and the router is a Porter-Cable 7500 Series.

There is no Kreg manual available but [this site](https://www.canadianwoodworking.com/kreg-precision-router-table-lift) has some instructions.
