At Kids' Open Make, families have access to our space, project kits,
materials, and hand tools to create, explore, and learn\!

Kids, tweens, and teens are welcome to bring their own projects or work
with ours. We also have crafts, electronics, Lego, snap circuits, games,
Little Bits, robots, Minecraft, and more. There is no charge for this
event and all ages are welcome.

*Note*: This is not a drop off activity. **Parents must stay with their
children to assist with projects**. While we welcome all families,
please be aware that Tampa Hackerspace is an active workshop and young
children must be closely supervised at all times.

A few of our special projects have a small fee to cover the cost of
materials for take-home items. These projects are optional; the rest of
the Kids' Open Make event is free of charge.

We use quite a few consumable materials in our Kid's Open Make program,
and we rely on donations from members and visitors to keep our kids'
shelves stocked. We keep a list of needed items on our website.

Cash donations are always gratefully accepted. Look for the donation jar
when you get here.

## Past Projects

  - Hardware tear downs: Some kids are often fascinated by what is
    inside electronics. Others just like to break stuff. Some components
    are salvaged for use in member projects.
