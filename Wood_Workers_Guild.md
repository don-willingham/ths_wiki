Half the time is spent discussing a technique, and half the time is spent on shop improvements.

As with all Hackerspace meetups, this is a great place to bounce design ideas, etc. with other like-minded people.

Ideas for beginner projects would be very helpful - something that take no longer than 3-4 hours that would actually be useful or giftable. I don't want to have people making things that will end up in the trash if it can be avoided.
