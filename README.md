# Tampa Hacker Space Wiki
Started originally as a possible new "wiki" for the Tampa Hackerspace. However, this is changing directions, into generating an offline version of the wiki. The current live instance is now running on mediawiki 1.28.1. That mediawiki is located at https://wiki.tampahackerspace.com/.

Usage:
  - Run getMediaWikiTxt.pl
  - Run pandoc.sh
  - Run fixMarkdownLinks.pl

TODO:
  - Don't save "redirect" pages
  - Remove leading '_' (underscore) in Category/tools subdirectories
  - Add something to generate offline .epub/.pdf
